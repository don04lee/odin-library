Library App

This is my solution to the Odin Project's library project. This project utilizes object-oriented programming specifically with the usage of JS.

The main purpose of this project is to be able to add and record books that have been read with its pages, title, and author. There is also the option to toggle whether the book has been read or not. In addition, the books can be removed.

The most difficult part of this project was trying to get the toggle of whether the book has been read or not, and changing the nature of the class and the object's values themselves at the same time. In addition, finding a method to remove the object from the library when clicking the remove button was hard.
